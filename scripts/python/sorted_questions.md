### Question 7

metadata[^vid-dGrTCOEB]

In what is now Washington state, the Tulalip Tribes operate the Hibulb Cultural Center. Relying on traditional knowledge to guide the design of exhibits, this institution presents Tulalip history and culture to the tribes' citizens. The Comanche Nation, a tribe in Oklahoma, employs a similar strategy in its own cultural center. Both centers contrast with museums that aren’t Indigenous-led; when displaying Indigenous artifacts, such museums tend to anticipate mainly non-Indigenous audiences and rely on Euro-centric strategies for designing exhibits.

### Question 8

metadata[^vid-bSmIdGvP]

The museum of Modern Art (MOM
A) in New York City has an exhibition of video games that includes Pac-Man from 1980, which museum visitors can play on site, and SimCity 2000 from 1994, which visitors can see only in a video presentation. MOMA claims the video presentations are only for games that would be impractical to display in a playable form, but video games are an inherently interactive medium, a feature that is grossly absent in a video-only presentation.

Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?

A) It identifies a feature of many video games that is not shared by some of the games included in MOMA’s exhibition.  
B) It provides a claim about video games as art that both MOMA and the author accept as true.  
C) It describes a misconception about video games that the author believes is evident in MOMA’s choice about which video games to exhibit.  
D) It presents a consideration that the author thinks partly undermines MOMA’s approach to exhibiting video games.

### Question 9

metadata[^vid-tlewHihN]

In O'odham, an Indigenous language from the Southwest region of what is now the United States, gogs means "a dog", whereas gogogs is used to refer to several dogs. This phenomenon, in which an element of a root word is repeated, sometimes with modification, within another word that is related to the root word, is called reduplication. In this case, the element "go" in gogs gets repeated in gogogs. There are many examples of this type of reduplication in O'odham.

The text makes which point about the O'odham word gogogs?

A) It contains a repetition of the element "go" in gogs.
B) It doesn't have a clear equivalent in English.
C) It is the only word in O'odham that uses reduplication.
D) It is identical in meaning to several other words in O'odham.

### Question 10

metadata[^vid-TYiW1ciR]

Master and Commander, first published in 1969, is a novel in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey Maturin series, which includes twenty completed books. Some critics have found fault with the abrupt endings of Master and Commander and other books in the series, saying that they do not finish conclusively but arbitrarily stop. Other critics, however, argue that the books should not be thought of as discrete texts with traditional beginnings and endings but as a single incredibly long work, similar to other multivolume stories, such as John Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga.

Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?

A) The unusual structure that O'Brian uses for Master and Commander makes it one of his most intricate books.
B) Critics have differing views regarding the efficacy of the structures of the novels in the Aubrey Maturin series.
C) Some critics think the Aubrey/Maturin series should have the literary renown of The Forsyte Saga, while others disagree.
D) Many critics judge the Aubrey/Maturin novels to be remarkably entertaining despite flaws in the novels' structures.

### Question 11

metadata[^vid-HA5KIJUY]

"The monster" is an 1898 story by Stephen Crane. In the story, the character of Jim, a young boy, accidentally damages a peony (a flower) in the yard while his father is tending to the lawn. Crane depicts the dedication and care with which his father typically cares for his lawn, writing: **\_\_\_\_**

Which quotation from "The Monster" most effectively illustrates the claim?

A) "After some trouble [Jim's father] found the subject of the incident, the broken flower. Turning then, he saw the child lurking at the rear and scanning his countenance."
B) "[Jim's father] was shaving his lawn as if it were a priest's chin. All during the season he had worked at it in the coolness and peace of the evenings after supper. Even in the shadow of the cherry-trees the grass was strong and healthy."
C) "[Jim's father] paused, and with the howl of the machine no longer occupying the sense, one could hear the robins in the cherry trees arranging their affairs."
D) "[Jim] went on to the lawn, very slowly, and kicking wretchedly at the turf. Presently his father came along with the whirring machine, while the sweet, new grass blades spun from the knives."

### Question 12

metadata[^vid-g7DNZlTh]

![Figure](/sat/assets/imgs/vid-g7DNZlTh.png)

In a college course on urban affairs, a student asserts that increased traffic congestion in the 1990s in the United States was present both in very large cities such as New York City, New York, and smaller areas such as Allentown-Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Beaumont, Texas; though those smaller areas may have been less affected by traffic congestion than very large cities, this congestion also worsened in them over time.

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support the student's claim?

A) While the number of hours of traffic delay per commuter per year was always lower in the Allentown-Bethlehem, Pennsylvania area than in the New York City, New York area for each year between 1990 and 2000, the amount of traffic delay rose in both areas during this period.
B) In at least one of the three urban areas shown, the amount of traffic delay was less than 20 hours per person per year at one point between 1990 and 2000.
C) In 1992, the amount of traffic delay in the New York City, New York area was less than 20 hours per commuter per year.
D) Throughout the period between 1990 and 200, the annual amount of traffic delay per commuter was greater in the Allentown-Bethlehem, Pennsylvania area than in the New York City, New York area.

### Question 13

metadata[^vid-vtdUN2fp]

Biologist Rosanna Alegado believes that we might learn how multicellular organisms developed from single-celled ones if we understand why the single-celled organism Salpingoeca rosetta, the oldest living relative of animals, sometimes forms colonies of cells. Alegado and colleagues reviewed data from many studies of how S. rosetta responds when exposed to another type of single-celled organism, bacteria, including John P. Bowman's work with Algoriphagus ratkowskyi bacteria and Iftikhar Ahmed's work with Algoriphagus boritolerans bacteria. Alegado and colleagues concluded that both A. ratkowskyi and A. boritolerans might have played a role in the development of multicellular organisms.

Which finding, if true, would most directly support Alegado and colleagues' conclusion?

A) Bowman and Ahmed found that S. rosetta tended to form colonies after bacterial exposure.
B) Bowman found that S. rosetta tended to form colonies after bacterial exposure, but Ahmed did not.
C) Ahmed found that S. rosetta tended to form colonies after bacterial exposure, but Bowman did not.
D) Neither Bowman nor Ahmed found that S. rosetta tended to form colonies after bacterial exposure.

### Question 15

metadata[^vid-5uqHfqFf]

Previous research has shown that plant species with a narrow geographical range tend to be more genetically homogeneous than plant species with extensive ranges are. Based on these findings, researchers recently ran simulations to predict how the genetic variation of several species of Mammillaria, a genus of cactus found throughout the Americas, might change in different distribution conditions. One of these species, M. anniana, is found only in the state of Tamaulipas. The researchers simulated what would happen if M. anniana spread to new habitats outside Tamaulipas, and, consistent with previous findings, the results showed that\_\_\_\_

### Question 7

metadata[^vid-tjmU8SFW]

Text 1
Attempts to automate classification of music into genres have not been very successful, and we may be at the limit of what is technologically possible. But it's not clear that this is a worthwhile pursuit in any case--as Jin Ha Lee and Anh Thu Nguyen argue in their study of the South Korean band BTS, relationships between pieces of music may be best understood with concepts other than genre.
Text 2
Tango is a genre of music originally from Argentina and Uruguay that shares some harmonic and rhythmic similarities with the pagode genre. Automated genre classification systems typically struggle to draw distinctions in situations like this, but Yandre Costa and colleagues solved that problem by converting sound to images and having computers compare features of those images, an approach that demonstrates how much innovation is possible in this field.

Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the claim in the underline sentence of Text 1?

A) By arguing that people tend to disagree when identifying genre classifications for music
B) By suggesting that the concept of genre may become more useful for music listeners
C) By criticizing previous research into automated music genre classification for favoring specific genre categories
D) By asserting that it may be possible to improve automated classification systems

The following text is adapted from Adib Khorram's 2018 novel Darius the Great Is Not Okay. Darius, a teenager from the United States, is visiting his family members in Iran.

I dozed and floated on the clouds of Farsi that blew my way from the front seat of Dayi [Uncle] Jamsheed’s SUV.
It reminded me of when I was little, and Mom chanted to me in Farsi every night before bedtime. It's hard to describe Farsi chanting: the way Mom drew her voice out like the notes of a cello as she recited poems by Rumi or Hafez I didn't know what they meant, but that didn’t matter. It was quiet and soothing.

Base on the text, what does the narrator mainly remember about the times when his mother chanted to him?

A) That he liked the characters in the stories his mother made up while chanting
B) That his mother had music playing in the background while she chanted
C) That his mother didn’t usually chant at night
D) That he found the sound of his mother’s chanting to be calming

### Question 9

metadata[^vid-8zOOfA7E]

Horses and barn owls can see in three dimensions (3D), which helps them perceive distance and depth. Octopuses and squid are thought to lack 3D vision, many researchers once thought the same about cuttlefish, but Trevor Wardill and his team wanted to test whether this assumption was true. The team studied how cuttlefish wearing 3D glasses reacted to 3D images of shrimp (a favorite prey) projected on a tank wall. Cuttlefish changed their striking position to match the 3D images, suggesting that their vision is more like that of horses and barn owls than that of octopuses or squid.

Which choice best states the main idea of the text?

A) Researchers have long known that horses and barn owls can see in 3D.
B) Cuttlefish are surprisingly similar in structure to octopuses and squid.
C) Contrary to what many researchers had assumed, cuttlefish may be able to see in 3D.
D) The ability to see in 3D allows many animals to interact with one another.

In contrast, a peaking hydroelectric power plant (used when demand for electricity peaks) controls the flow of water through its generators: starting flow when demand is high enough, stopping it when demand is too low, and otherwise regulating it to keep pace with changing electricity needs. Although peaking plants do not typically operate continuously as run-of-river plants do, peaking plants can generate more megawatt-hours of power per year (MWh/yr) than some run-of-river plants.

### Question 13

metadata[^vid-irpErcrA]

The 2000 production of The Green Bird was the first Broadway show for which Constance Hoffman was credited as a costume designer. Hoffman was among the Broadway costume designers interviewed by Sara Jablon-Roberts and Eulanda A Sanders for their study of historical accuracy in costume design for shows with a historical setting. They found that even designers who value historical accuracy will often include contemporary design elements that don’t fit with the historical period. In a research paper about theatrical costume design, a student argues that costume designers for modern productions of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream (set in ancient Greece) sometimes include such elements unintentionally. Which quotation from an interview with a costume designer would most effectively support the student's claim?

In a 2012 study in the United States, Michael E. Berndt and Travis K. Bavin found a positive association between levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury in bodies of fresh water. Many other studies have yielded similar results, suggesting to some scientists that this association is true for all bodies of fresh water. But much of that research has been conducted at broadly similar sites in North America, and when Seam Noh and colleagues examined bodies of fresh water in South Korea, they found a negative association between dissolved organic carbon levels and mercury levels. If similar findings emerge from other locations outside North America, that could suggest that \_\_\_\_. Which choice most logically completes the text?  
A) the mercury levels reported in Noh and colleagues' study were much higher than those reported in the study by Brebdt and Bavin even though the dissolved organic carbon levels reported in the two studies were approximately the same.

B) Berndt and Bavin may have inadvertently measured a different characteristic of bodies of fresh water than their levels of dissolved organic carbon and mercury.

C) the relationship between dissolved organic carbon and mercury reported by Berndt and Bavin reflects conditions that are characteristic of certain kinds of ecosystems in North America rather than universal conditions.

D) most of the studies conducted in North America have measured dissolved organic carbon and mercury levels at a higher level of precision than was the case in Noh and colleagues’ study.
